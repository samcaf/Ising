# Extra Models

I want to implement more models than are currently in this folder, and do associated computations.

## Thoughts
* Random couplings, localization
* Exactly solvable models? [1]
    * d^2E / d h^2 and quantum phase transitions
* Stabilizer models? [2]
    * Entanglement binegativity, though I don't know what this means
* CFTs
    * Dicts of params for cfts
    * Entanglement entropy formulae/matching
        * Basic code here done, want examples
    * Entanglement entropy of excited states
        * To read: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08815.pdf
* SUSY models?
    * Fat fermions
    * Ladder models
        * https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys.11.3.059/pdf
	* https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11073.pdf
    * Emergent SUSY at boundary of topological phase
        * Appendix A of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.7449.pdf
    * Interested in entanglement entropy
    * Interested in near-critical behavior
    * Interested in thermalization in different supersymmetry-sectors
    * Interested in the presence of BPS states, and features such as entanglement in BPS states and other solitons actually
	* e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08330.pdf
	* Search github
* Expanding lattice?
    * https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11658.pdf
