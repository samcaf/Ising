# Extra Models

I want to implement more models than are currently in this folder, and do associated computations.

## Thoughts
* Random couplings, localization
* Exactly solvable models? [1]
    * d^2E / d h^2 and quantum phase transitions
* Stabilizer models? [2]
    * Entanglement binegativity, though I don't know what this means
* SUSY models?
    * Interested in entanglement entropy
    * Interested in near-critical behavior
    * Interested in thermalization in different supersymmetry-sectors
    * Interested in the presence of BPS states, and features such as entanglement in BPS states and other solitons actually
	* e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08330.pdf
	* Search github
