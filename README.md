# Ising

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/standard--readme-OK-green.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

A python toolbox for calculations on one dimensional quantum spin chains. Includes model Hamiltonians, operators, symmetries, spectrum analysis, entropy calculations, and examples.

Special thanks to Nick O'Dea, who provided versions of a great deal of this code as well as a great deal guidance as I adjusted it. It is my understanding that O'Dea developed some of the code that he gave me in part in collaboration with Vedika Khemani. I am extremely grateful to both of them!
